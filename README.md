# Tumor Detection
A Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among children and adults. Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System(CNS) tumors. Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist, which is a manual process.

Our primary objective is to develop an accurate and efficient deep learning algorithm that can analyze medical images and rapidly predict the presence of tumors. By leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our approach aims to automate and expedite the detection process, leading to faster diagnoses and improved patient outcomes.

## General Information
A Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among children and adults. Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System(CNS) tumors. Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The 5-year survival rate for people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and36 percent for women. Brain Tumors are classified as: Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, etc. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve the life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist which is a manual process. 
Application of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI)has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification. Hence, proposing a system performing detection and classification by using Deep Learning Algorithms using ConvolutionNeural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and TransferLearning (TL) would be helpful to doctors all around the world.

## Conclusions
In this project, we developed a deep learning model for tumor detection using medical images. The model demonstrated a commendable performance by achieving a recall score of 0.7893. While the model exhibits signs of overfitting, it remains robust and proficient in identifying tumors even in previously unseen images.
Our work showcases the potential of deep learning in medical image analysis and tumor detection. While the current iteration of the model is promising, future enhancements could focus on addressing overfitting and optimizing the architecture to achieve even higher accuracy and reliability.
